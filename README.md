For our final project we will be making a story generator that prompts the user for words and names that will then generate a short story for them based on that input {This is still a work in progress}

We will use the Django python package to handle the back-end work and API request and parsing. We are thinking about using React for the front end of the web-site

The key words entered by the user will be used to help determine what kind of story the system will generate {example: words like rush and excitement would help the software generate an action adventure story}. The number of names involved in the story will be chosen by the user from an interactive front end call using React, as will the key words used in the story. We will also have certain key words that when entered into the words prompt will produce a certain story genre, using the name of the genre as the key word like adventure or fantasy.
